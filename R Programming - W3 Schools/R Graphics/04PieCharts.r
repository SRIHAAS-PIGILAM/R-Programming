# R Pie Charts:


#A pie chart is a circular graphical view of data.

#Use the pie() function to draw pie charts:

# Create a vector of pies
x <- c(10,20,30,40)

# Display the pie chart
pie(x)

#As you can see the pie chart draws one pie for each value in the vector (in this case 10, 20, 30, 40).

#By default, the plotting of the first pie starts from the x-axis and move counterclockwise.

#The size of each pie is determined by comparing the value with all the other values, by using this formula:

#The value divided by the sum of all values: x/sum(x)





# Start Angle:

#you can change the start angle of the pie chart with the init.angle parameter.

#The value of init.angle is defined with angle in degrees, where default angle is 0.

#Start the first pie at 90 degrees:

# Create a vector of pies
x <- c(10,20,30,40)

# Display the pie chart and start the first pie at 90 degrees
pie(x, init.angle = 90)




#Labels and Header:
#Use the label parameter to add a label to the pie chart, and use the main parameter to add a header:

# Create a vector of pies
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)

# Create a vector of labels
mylabel <- c("Apples", "Bananas", "Cherries", "Dates")

# Display the pie chart with labels
pie(x, label = mylabel, main = "Fruits")






#Colors:
#You can add a color to each pie with the col parameter:
# Create a vector of colors
colors <- c("blue", "yellow", "green", "red")

# Display the pie chart with colors
pie(x, label = mylabel, main = "Fruits", col = colors)





#Legend:
#To add a list of explanation for each pie, use the legend() function:
# Create a vector of labels
mylabel <- c("Apples", "Bananas", "Cherries", "Dates")

# Create a vector of colors
colors <- c("blue", "yellow", "green", "red")

# Display the pie chart with colors
pie(x, label = mylabel, main = "Pie Chart", col = colors)

# Display the explanation box
legend("bottomright", mylabel, fill = colors)

#The legend can be positioned as either:

#sbottomright, bottom, bottomleft, left, topleft, top, topright, right, center
