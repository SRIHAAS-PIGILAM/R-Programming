# R divides the operators in the following groups:


# Arithmetic operators

print(2^5) # same as 2*2*2*2*2-power

# %%	Modulus (Remainder from division)	x %% y
print(5 %% 2)

# %/%	Integer Division	x%/%y
print(15 %/% 2)

# the integer divison (%/%) rounds the result down to the nearest whole number

# Assignment operators

y_var <- 3

my_var <<- 3

3 -> my_var

3 ->> my_var

print(my_var) # print my_var


# Comparison operators

# ==	Equal	x == y
# ( !=	Not equal	x != y
# >	Greater than	x > y
#<	Less than	x < y
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

# Logical operators



# Operator	Description
#   &	    Element-wise Logical AND operator. It returns TRUE if both elements are TRUE
#   &&	    Logical AND operator - Returns TRUE if both statements are TRUE
#   |	    Elementwise- Logical OR operator. It returns TRUE if one of the statement is TRUE
#   ||	    Logical OR operator. It returns TRUE if one of the statement is TRUE.
#   (!	    Logical NOT - returns FALSE if statement is TRUE


# Miscellaneous operators

# Operator	Description	Example
#   :	        Creates a series of numbers in a sequence	    x <- 1:10
#   %in%	    Find out if an element belongs to a vector	    x %in% y
#   %*%	        Matrix Multiplication	                        x <- Matrix1 %*% Matrix2
