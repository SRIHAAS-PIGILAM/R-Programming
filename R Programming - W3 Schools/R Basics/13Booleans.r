# Booleans (Logical Values)

# In programming, you often need to know if an expression is true or false.

# You can evaluate any expression in R, and get one of two answers, TRUE or FALSE.

# When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and R returns the logical answer:

print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)


a <- 10
b <- 9

print(a > b)
