# R also has many built-in math functions that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

# For example, the min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest number in a set:

print(max(5, 10, 15))

print(min(5, 10, 15))


# The sqrt() function returns the square root of a number:
print(sqrt(16))

# The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of a number:
print(abs(-4.7))

# The ceiling() function rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the floor() function rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

print(ceiling(1.4))
print(floor(1.4))
