# Define 2 vectors
# cars - c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9)
# trucks - c(2, 5, 4, 5, 12)

# Graph cars using a y-axis that ranges from 0 to 12
# plot(cars, type = "o", col = "blue", ylim = c(0, 12))

# Graph trucks with red dashed lines and square points
# lines(trucks, type = "o", pch = 22, lty = 2, col = "red")

# Create a title with a red, bold/italic font
# title(main = "Autos", col.main = "red", font.main = 4)


# The code you provided contains a couple of errors in how the variables cars and trucks are defined. You should use the assignment operator <- to define variables in R. Here's the corrected code:

# Define 2 vectors
cars <- c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9)
trucks <- c(2, 5, 4, 5, 12)

# Graph cars using a y-axis that ranges from 0 to 12
plot(cars, type = "o", col = "blue", ylim = c(0, 12))

# Graph trucks with red dashed lines and square points
lines(trucks, type = "o", pch = 22, lty = 2, col = "red")

# Create a title with a red, bold/italic font
title(main = "Autos", col.main = "red", font.main = 4)

# With these corrections, your code should work as intended, creating a plot with blue lines for cars and red dashed lines with square points for trucks, along with the specified title.
